# Supply-Chain-Management-Dashboard-using-PowerBI

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing supply chain order fulfillment performance using Python and Power BI. The aim is to identify bottlenecks, assess key performance indicators (KPIs), and derive actionable insights to improve operational efficiency across the supply chain process.

---

##  Project Objective

To evaluate and enhance supply chain performance through:

* Data-driven analysis of order fulfillment
* Visualization of critical KPIs
* Identification of inefficiencies in lead times, delays, and stock availability

---

##  Tools & Technologies Used

* **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**:

  * Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  * Purpose: Data cleaning, transformation, EDA

* **Power BI**:

  * Purpose: Interactive dashboards and visualization of supply chain KPIs

* **Dataset**: `supply_chain_data.csv`

  * Real-world supply chain data including product SKUs, order dates, availability, production volume, and revenue
